### 1. Who collected the data?

Murray Cox，the founder of the Inside Airbnb site，collected the data which was sourced from publicly available information from the Airbnb site[1].

---

### 2. Why did they collect it?

The Inside Airbnb involves dataset of different cities around the world where London is included. They collected it voluntarily for institutions, researchers and others who is concerned to allow public analysis, discussion and community benefit. Based on the data, individuals can explore how Airbnb is really being used[2].

### 3. How was it collected?

The data was collected by web scraping with many packages of Python and other essential tools. And the source is the website of every listing in London on Airbnb. With the efficient program, the operator obtained the desired information by retrieving the source code of the web page. After being verified, cleansed, analyzed and aggregated, the final dataset was set up. The results were saved in CSV format for ease of use.

### 4. What useful information does it contain?

The dataset contains the information on all aspects of the listings, hosts and reviews. The information about houses includes the room, the price, the location and the amenities, etc. It also shows some necessary knowledge about the hosts as well as their reputation and response. Besides, the number and scores of reviews from guests are also included. What's more specific, it contains the coordinate, the overview of the neighborhood and the recent availability. These cover almost all the publicly available information on the Airbnb site about a particular listing.

### 5. What useful information is it missing?

The data doesn't contain the information about the guests and the orders which is influential for analysis. And in this data set, we can't see the changes in the price of the listings over time. Besides, the available date，specific comments and reviewers' information are also missing.

### 6. To what extent is the data 'complete'?

The data set is relatively complete in recording the information on the website. However, according to the Deregulation Act 2015, the hosts can short-term rent your entire home for 90 days of the calendar year without a permit[3]. There is a possibility that some hosts will hide their rental information to avoid legal restrictions. Therefore, the listings information in the dataset may not be complete because of the hidden behaviour. 

Moreover, the information about the guests and the orders isn't in the dataset. And the comments and reviewers' information are also missing. The lack of these information makes it impossible to analyze the user behaviour. In conclusion, the dataset is complete in the essential part except for users' data, and some hidden data didn't be considered.

### 7. What kinds of analysis would this support?

With the detailed data set, many commercial issues and social issues can be analyzed. For the Airbnb platform, the data is supported to analyze the operation status, the business model and whether the hosts conform to the regulations, which is instructive to standardize and improve the platform. For the guests, we are able to screen out the listings with high quality and reasonable price, helping consumers to choose a satisfactory one. For society, the positional information in the data set can support the analysis of the distribution and spatial penetration of the listings in London that can raise a number of practical questions(e.g.the varying of the listings' prices based on the location can imply the commercial prosperity level in different area in London). Combined with other relevant data, it can also support exploring the Airbnb's impact on the housing structure and hotel industry in the local area.

### 8. What kinds of analysis would it _not_ support?

The missing of users' data is an impediment for which we can't do any user-specific analysis, such as user portrait, user preferences and user viscosity，etc. Also, We can't the see the changes in price and the number of orders, so it's unable to analyze the fluctuation of the market(e.g.the high and low season of the consumption). Due to the lack of comments and reviewers, the analyses of specific consumption experience are not be supported. Therefore, we can't be clear about the emergencies and terrible experiences the consumers faced when living.

### 9. Which of the uses presented in Q.7 and Q.8 are _ethical_?

It is ethical to analyze the condition, the price and the amenities of the listings because the data used is publicly available from the website. And it can bring lots of conveniences and valuable suggestions for the platform, the guests and society. The data did not violate anyone's privacy and was obtained with the informed consent of the homeowner. As for the specific location of the listings which is detailed to the room, it is critical to collect and analyze. Because the leak of a tenant's location is likely to pose a security risk. 

It should be very vigilant when analyzing the users' information mentioned in Q.8. People's privacy often accompanies these personal data. Consumers may not want to reveal too much about themselves. Many people are not well informed about the extent of data collection or how many parties can purchase access to their data. Data platforms can represent an ‘omnopticon’ where the many surveil the many[4]. So it's necessary to take steps to protect people's privacy such as changing the names of users to ensure their anonymity.

What is critical, Airbnb claims to be part of the "sharing economy" and disrupting the hotel industry. Data shows that the majority of Airbnb listings in most cities are entire homes, many of which are rented all year round disrupting housing and communities[5]. In the analysis of the data, we are supposed to pay more attention to the prominent social phenomenon. We should be critical to analyze the cause of the phenomenon and try to make the research meaningful. Taking a stand of ethic,  there is a need to recognize the "sharing economy" brought by Airbnb dialectically.
